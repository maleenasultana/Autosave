# Autosave
the project is fully functional as we can create, update, delete and get information about a created note.
backend created using nodejs and expressjs where all the api's can be checked in postman on localhost 5000 
for signup   #localhost:5000/api/auth/createuser
for signin  paste the token in header in authtoken in login using api # localhost:5000/api/auth/login
for all crud operations we have to use tokens and routes.

in frontend UI is simple 
it will create notes after filling form with name, description and tag  and submit.
all the entries can be seen in mongoDB.
